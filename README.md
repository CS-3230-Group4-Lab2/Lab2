# Lab2
Lab 2 
Due Tuesday by  9:30pm[End of Class Tuesday]   
 Points 2 
 Available  after May 28 at 8:20pm

Create a program with a collection of students from the class. Remember that students in the class are unique, and can therefore only be in the collection once. The Student object has a First and Last name, a score, and an associated partner (another Student object). Also, each student will contain chat responses. Each Student should have a separate collection of chat responses, each with at least 5 different responses. The responses should be ordered, as conversation responses.

Use these Students to create conversation pairs and display the conversation between each pair as output. This output can be done either in the IDE or the console. This is in preparation for a chat client which will begin with next week's lab, so make sure to use good Object Oriented principles in your design, so that you can use the methods and classes you create this week in upcoming labs. Remember also to use the correct collection types for the requirements.

The project is to be done in the assigned pairs, and will be turned in as a group demo and individual repository submission. You will zip your project's .git folder and submit the zipped file.

Example output:

Student 1: Hello

Student 2: Hi

Student 1: Well, this is weird

Note that I am working with GitHub to get the CS 3230 organization set up, and we will be using those private repositories as our for submission and collaboration center as soon as they are available.
